        &emsp; Every time I get in the car, I can feel the luxury and desire of
        driving BMW. I once drove from Minneapolis to Chicago. It was a long
        drive, but I didn't feel tired. This car accompanies me to go to and
        from school and to the supermarket every day.Sitting in the car, I can
        feel that I am the owner here, which is the feeling that other places
        can not give me. I want to thank my parents for giving me this
        opportunity to buy this car and fulfill my childhood dream.
