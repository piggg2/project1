        1. &emsp;The website I created is aimed at people who want to know about
        BMW models. I made a lot of pages to let them know what kind of car they
        want to know. I also gave them the link to the website to give them
        insight. My web page contains many pictures for them to understand, and
        I also add many of my own opinions.

        2. &emsp; At first, the client said that the color of my web page was
        too monotonous, only black and white. And they felt they needed more
        pictures to help explain the content. They want to see more interesting
        content and some feedback.
